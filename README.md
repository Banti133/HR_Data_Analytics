# HR Data Analytics 

This repository contains the code and resources for an HR data analytics project aimed at uncovering insights from employee data. 

It leverages SQL for data extraction and transformation, EDA for initial exploration, and Power BI for interactive data visualization.

Project Goals:

Identify key trends and patterns in HR data.
Gain insights into employee demographics and performance.
Generate visualizations to support data-driven HR decisions.

Project Structure:

Data: Contains the raw HR data file (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Sql file:Using MYSQL Workbench for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. Script to clean and prepare the raw data. Collection of queries for exploratory analysis.

Powerbi: Stores the Power BI Desktop report file (.pbix) and any supporting visuals.

Documentation(Report): Includes detailed documentation on your project methodology and findings.

Getting Started:

Import Data: Load the HR data file into your chosen DBMS.

Database Connection: Establish a connection to your database within your SQL client and Power BI Desktop.

Run SQL Queries: Execute the scripts in the sql folder to clean, transform, and analyze the data.

Explore with Power BI:
Import the cleaned data from the database into Power BI Desktop.

Create visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) to explore your findings.

Consider using Power BI's data modeling and filtering capabilities for further analysis.

Document Findings: Document your project methodology, data cleaning steps, key insights, and visualizations in the documentation folder.
